## cobol-testscripts




## Purpose

This COBOL codebase implements various basic programming concepts and operations, including user input/output, arithmetic calculations, control structures, file handling, and simple data processing. It serves as a collection of examples demonstrating fundamental COBOL programming techniques.

## File Summaries

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| PerformTimes.cbl | Demonstrates loop structures using PERFORM statements. |
| Multiply.cbl | Performs multiplication operations on user-input numbers and displays formatted results. |
| IncrementExample.cbl | Increments and displays numbers from 1 to a user-specified value. |
| NestedIFExample.cbl | Illustrates nested IF structures for conditional logic based on user input. |
| IF-Example.cbl | Checks and corrects user input case, demonstrating simple string manipulation. |
| SeqFileExample.cbl | Handles sequential file operations for writing and reading user records. |
| UserInput.cbl | Accepts user input and displays a personalized greeting message. |
| PerformExample.cbl | Showcases the use of PERFORM statements for procedure organization and execution. |
| Message.cbl | Displays a predefined message to the user. |
| HelloWorld.cbl | A simple "Hello World" program in COBOL. |

## File Interactions

- No significant direct interactions between files are apparent, as each file appears to be a standalone example or exercise.
- The files collectively demonstrate various COBOL programming concepts and can be used as reference or learning materials.
